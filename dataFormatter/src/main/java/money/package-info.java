You can use Money and Currency API (JSR 354). This API is expected to be part of Java 9. You can use this API in Java 7 and Java 8, provided you add appropriate dependencies to your project.

For Java 8, add the following reference implementation as a dependency to your pom.xml:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.javamoney</groupId>
    <artifactId>moneta</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
This dependency will transitively add javax.money:money-api as a dependency.

You can then use the API:
See MoneyTest.java
